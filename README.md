# About the project
This is the code for a 6-axis/GPS based lap timer running on Linux.

The initial prototype is being developed using Rust on a Raspberry Pi 4, running Ubuntu-MATE desktop.
Then it will be ported to a compact linux SBC running a custom Linux build.

The 6-axis sensor used is an MPU-6050 and the GPS sensor a "blox NEO-6M-0-001" installed on a GPS6MV2 PCB
